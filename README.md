# ESG-X-Stocks-optimization
Sustaibility is an increasingly growing concern for many companies globally. From mitigating waste to reducing CO2 emissions, both stakeholders and customers are not only concerned with value of the stocks they invest in but whether the company cares about sustainable practices.  
This project aims to provide a stock portfolio that optimizes for both returns and ESG scores (a metric representing a company's sustainability and ethical practices).
